For example, if your backlog is set on Tuesday, you can hold your first SCRUM meeting during the lab on Wednesday.</li>\n<li>Scheduled SCRUM meetings should not be held on the same day as the backlog is set or the same day as another SCRUM meeting.</li>\n<li>If you have more than 3 SCRUM meetings, which you are encouraged to have, you may hold them more frequently.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span>Sprint Retrospective Meeting</span></h3>\n<p><span>At the completion of each sprint, <strong>the team</strong> will undertake a retrospective together. In the retrospective, the team should discuss what went right and wrong during the previous sprint, what changes (if any) need to be made regarding procedure, and what adjustments might need to be made to the product backlog.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><em><strong>The</strong>&nbsp;<strong>retrospective should be completed before the next sprint backlog is determined.</strong></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span>Backlogs</span></h3>\n<p><span style=color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;>Your <strong>product backlog</strong> contains the list of tasks with their priorities, dependencies, time estimates, and status. It should be <strong>updated continually</strong> throughout the project.&nbsp;<br></span></p>\n<p><span style=color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;>Your <strong>sprint backlog</strong> is a subset of the product backlog.

While your project will be graded on overall accomplishment, it will also be graded on how well you met your sprint goals.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span>Burn-down Charts</span></h3>\n<p>You will maintain two burn-down charts: a sprint burn-down chart and a product burn-down chart. Burn-down charts show both the estimated and actual hours over time.&nbsp; <em><strong>Always report burn-down charts in remaining hours (not number of tasks).</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The initial sprint burn-down chart is created from the sprint backlog. It should be updated after each SCRUM meeting based on team member status and feedback.</li>\n<li>The product burn-down chart should be updated once during the sprint and again at the end of the sprint.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>We recommend that the SCRUM master keep track of this data in a multi-page google form, where each team member gets a separate page. Each team-member, at the end of each day updates their part in the form (what they think is remaining for each feature he is responsible for). In the form, another page summarizing the total remaining work for each feature, which makes the production of a graph illustrating progress (or lack thereof) easy.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>GitHub Release Link</h3>\n<p><span>You will use TAMU GitHub for managing your code. Each person working on the code should update the code each time a feature is added. There should be regular check-ins of code, and no items should be considered \u201ccomplete\u201d unless they have been checked into TAMU GitHub.</span></p>\n<p><span>At the end of each sprint, the source code for the project, to that point, should be turned in by the sprint completion deadline. <em><strong>At the end of a sprint, you should have a completely working version of the software</strong></em>, although <span>some features may not be included if they are scheduled for later sprints. This is called the <em><strong>Minimum Viable Product (MVP) </strong></em>and will be used for user studies. </span>Note that if the sprint is completed ahead of time, this can be turned in sooner (and progress can be made toward the next sprint).</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Make sure you give the TAs access</strong> to your repo as a Collaborator.</span></li>\n<li><span>The p</span><span>roject manager should <strong>create a&nbsp;</strong></span><strong><a class=external href=https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository target=_blank>release</a></strong><span> when code is due at each sprint completion deadline.</span></li>\n</ul>"}, {"name": "Canvas Project 3 Deliverable: End-Project Individual Status Report and Retrospective", "class": "22 SPRING CSCE 315 PROGRAMMING STUDIO", "priority": 3, "dueDate": "2022-05-08T23:59", "startDate": "2022-05-02T00:00", "link": "https://canvas.tamu.edu/courses/134641/assignments/1207584", "relatedLinks": "", "googleLocation": "", "canvasLocation": "22 SPRING CSCE 315 PROGRAMMING STUDIO", "complete": false, "notes": ""}, {"name": "Canvas Bonus (and Prize) Opportunity: Project 3 Video", "class": "22 SPRING CSCE 315 PROGRAMMING STUDIO", "priority": 3, "dueDate": "2022-05-04T23:59", "startDate": "2022-04-25T08:00", "link": "https://canvas.tamu.edu/courses/134641/assignments/1227288", "relatedLinks": "", "googleLocation": "", "canvasLocation": "22 SPRING CSCE 315 PROGRAMMING STUDIO", "complete": false, "notes": "<p>To<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>get a boost in your in-class activity average worth 1 in-class activity</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>(an extra 10 points will be added to your in-class activity point total, even if it puts you over 100% for that grading category), <strong>create a 2-3 minute video</strong> <span>advertising and demoing your project. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<span>Your video should include the problem you are solving, why it is important, and a demo of your project action.</span><span style=color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark);
